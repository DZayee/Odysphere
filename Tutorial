Prerequisites
MetaMask/Rabby wallet installed (currently the only supported wallets).
If you set Phantom as the main EVM wallet, you would need to disable it in order to use the testnet with MetaMask/Rabby
 
Step 1: Connect to the App
Visit https://testnet.odysphere.io/
Click "Connect"
When prompted, add the Odysphere testnet network RPC to your wallet
 
Step 2: Get Testnet Tokens
Join the Odysphere Discord server - testnet-faucet Channel
Use the faucet command: $request [your-address]
You'll receive:
0.5 ODY (for gas) on Odysphere testnet
10 DYM on Dymension testnet (Blumbus)
 
Step 3: Transfer DYM to Odysphere
Use the deposit button on our testnet page
Transfer your DYM from Dymension Testnet (Blumbus) to Odysphere Testnet

Alternatively, you can use Transfer via the following link - https://testnet.dymension.xyz/ibc/transfer?sourceId=blumbus_111-1&destinationId=odysphere_654689-1
 
Step 4: Import Tokens to MetaMask
Click the arrow in your wallet section
Select "Import" for both DYM and ODY tokens
 
Step 5: Open a Vault
Click "Open Vault"
Choose the amount of DYM to deposit
Select how much OUSD to borrow
Approve the transaction
Confirm to open your vault
 
Additional Actions
Borrow more OUSD
Repay borrowed OUSD
Deposit OUSD into the Stability Pool
 
Explore the app to familiarize yourself with its features and functionality.

****Important Note:**
The minimum debt for an open vault is 1 OUSD. When repaying, you must maintain at least 1 OUSD in debt if you wish to keep the vault open. To close a vault entirely:
- Buy OUSD from the Dymension testnet pool
- Transfer the OUSD to Odysphere testnet
- Repay the full debt, including any accrued interest
Please note that interest begins accruing immediately upon borrowing. Ensure you have enough OUSD to cover both the principal and accrued interest when closing your vault.
